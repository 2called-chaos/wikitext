The "ragel" branch was an experimental branch in which I explored
the feasibility of replacing the existing ANTLR lexer with a
Ragel-based scanner.

My suspicion was that the Ragel scanner might be faster and in the
end benchmarking showed that it was nearly 10 times faster. Other
benefits of switching to Ragel included: liberation from ANTLR's
Java-based toolchain, scanner code with zero runtime dependencies
(no libraries), avoid unnecessary conversions back and forth
between UTF-8 and UCS-2 encoded strings, and the simpler,
easier-to-understand nature of Ragel's state machines (no "black
magic").

To that end the "ragel" branch was merged into "master" on 4 February
2008, replacing the existing ANTLR-based code which itself was forked
off into an "antlr" branch for historical archiving.
