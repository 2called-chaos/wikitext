new paragraph

= a heading =

> a blockquote
> second line of blockquote

> new paragraph within blockquote

== another heading ==

paragraph within ''multiple '''styles''''' and <tt>tt span</tt>

similar, but with '''styles in ''different'' order'''

again, a '''different ''order'''''

* list item 1
** nested list item 1
** nested list item 2
** nested list item 3
* list item 2

 // this is a code block
 notice how it can contain ''markup''
 which would '''otherwise''' have <tt>special</tt> meaning
 although explicit entities &copy; are passed through unchanged

a normal paragraph again

# this is an ordered list
# which continues
## and has another ordered list
## nested inside it
# and then falls back
#* and then nests another list
#* this time an unordered one
#** itself containing a nested list
#** which continues
#**# and finally nests yet another ordered list
#**# which continues
#* drops back quite a way
# and finally all the way
#****** and finishes with an invalid item

=== heading with missing closing tag
* list
# new list
